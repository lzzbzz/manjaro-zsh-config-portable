Hello! The organizational email that I used to make my github account is being deleted soon so 
I've been transferring my repositories to my personal account and plan to delete the paul0258 account.

I'm not sure if the deletion of my paul0258 github account will affect your fork, but just to be safe it might be a good idea to
change your base repository to Herschenglime/manjaro-zsh-config-portable instead.

I've since changed how I configure my shell to instead use the zsh quickstart kit, so I don't plan on making 
any changes to the repo any time soon;
the paul0258 and Herschenglime branches are identical, so it should be an easy change.

Good luck!
